Dynamic Programming emphasize more in optimization rather than just plain recursion.
Recursive solution usually has continous call exactly similar inputs therefore
whenever we see them we have to optimize is by applying Dynamic Programming

We have to use Dynamic programming solution for solving this n-queen problem.
In n queen problem the n queens are to be placed in the chess in way that no queen threat
other queen. The queen attack horizontally, vertically and diagonally therefore new
queen should be placed in a position which is not threatened by previously placed queens.
This problem is solved by simple O(f(n)8^n) solution which is based on dynamic programming
In which f(n) is a low order polynomial which is shown to be first non trivial upper bound
for the problem.

One of the main advantage of dynamic programming is its process breaks down any problem
that is complex and convert it into interrelated series for many subproblems it mostly
provides the insight to the problems nature
