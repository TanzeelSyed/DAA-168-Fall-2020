## Assignment_1 N-Queen Solution by Brute-Force Algorithm ##
   ## Brute-force Algorithm Analysis ##

Brute Force Algorithms are just what they sound like, basic methods that rely on pure computational power 
to solve a problem and try every possibility to increase performance rather than sophisticated techniques.

The brute force algorithm looks for all text positions between 0 and n-m, whether or not the pattern begins there. 
After each attempt, precisely 1 location moves the pattern to the right. In this algorithm, the time complexity is O(m*n) 
so if we reach for n characters in a string of m characters, n*m tries will be needed.

The biggest drawback of the brute-force approach is that the number of natural candidates is prohibitively high for certain real-world issues. 
If n is a 64-bit natural random number, which has an average of about 19 decimal digits, it will take about 10 years to check.

The benefit of this method is that to use one of these algorithms, you do not need any domain-specific expertise.
For solving the problem, a brute-force algorithm aims to use the simplest possible approach.
